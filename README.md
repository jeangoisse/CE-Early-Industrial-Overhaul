### FAQ
###### *Why no workshop release ?*

Well, for licensing reasons first. 
This mod includes copy-righted works from various authors. I contacted them and they are okay if the mod stays on **github only**.

Although, despite playing Rimworld for over 5 years now, I don't even own it on Steam yet so all my mods are github only.
###### *Why make a fork and not patching ?*

Well, it was a hard decision to make when I started working on this. Making a fork was MUCH more easier and faster than patching all those mods. It's only because of simplicity. But reminds, the mod is in early-developpment state and <u>changes may come</u>. I plan to make a patch version of the new researches only on the future.
###### *Why so many incompats ?*

Listed incompatible mods are <u>already included</u>, partially or totally meaning both mods can't load.
###### *Why Gun Galore Core is a hard requirement ?*

It is needed for some sounds and for the nice workbench texture.
###### *What about other guns and later eras ?*

**For now, you can't really use this mod with other weapon mods.** 

**I strongly advise you to not trying to run the gunpack with any other mod adding guns, because their researches, ammosets and recipes will need patches in order to function !!**
